I'm trying to learn about creating RESTful services using Spring CXF.

The work is based mostly on

Started with http://www.insaneprogramming.be/?p=140
Continued with http://blog.furiousbob.com/2011/12/06/hateoas-restful-services-using-spring-3-1/
Consulted http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-restful/ about JSON mapping

Status:

Runs, when I try to retrieve a time, I get this message:
No message body writer has been found for response class ResponseEntity.

So that's the next task.
