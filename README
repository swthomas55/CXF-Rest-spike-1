I'm trying to learn about creating RESTful services using Spring CXF.

Right now, I'm getting an error trying to run it with tomcat (mvn tomcat:run), as shown:

INFO: Marking servlet CXFServlet as unavailable
Mar 27, 2012 8:30:22 AM org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContext loadOnStartup
SEVERE: Servlet /rest-cxf-1 threw load() exception
java.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.cxf.transport.servlet.CXFServlet cannot be cast to javax.servlet.Servlet

I've tried a number of things, such as updating versions of maven dependencies on Spring, CXF, Java servlet. I'm currently configured with Tomcat 6, maybe I should go to 7? If you have any ideas, I'd be happy to hear them. I'm pretty sure it's a dependency version mismatch of some sort, but don't know how to diagnose it.

The work is based mostly on
